1) I want to build a website that gets movie information (title, director, year, and so on) from an API 
and render it.
We need a search bar to work with the API
We need to fetch the information from that API
We need to render that information on screen (poster, title, year, director and summary) to start with

2) I want to integrate this with a "to watch" list, so I need buttons to add and remove movies to that list.
